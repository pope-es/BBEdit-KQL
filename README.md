BBEdit-KQL
==========

A BBEdit Language Module for Microsoft's KQL (Kusto Query Language).


Installation
------------

In BBEdit, click the menu entry `BBEdit -> Folder -> Language Modules`.

This will open a Finder window in the folder `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules`. Copy the file `KustoQueryLanguage.plist` to this folder, and restart BBEdit.


Usage
-----

After restarting BBEdit, the Document Language menu (at the bottom of the editor windows) will have a new entry for `KQL (Kusto Query Language)`. It will also be used automatically for files with a `.kql` extension.


Notes
-----

Note that Microsoft's KQL (Kusto) is not related to Kibana's KQL (Kibana Query Language), although they are used in similar situations.
